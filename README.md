# hotelBookingSystem
Project to make a simple hotel booking system using Spring Boot

Will need to change the application.properties details for the name of the database schema and the sql password.

When run, it will automatically create a user with the username "user1" and password "pw1". 
It will also automatically create 5 rooms of each type, along with some fixed bookings under the user1's account.
